    <td>I learnt, successfully, in this lesson, to be capable of assigning values to certain phrases (in this case Prophets and False Believers), and, when accessing the Print tool, to print these phrases as strings of numbers (or values) rather than the words themselves. I learnt this through more successful collaborative work (specifically with my partner, Rory), and intent reading of the provided materials.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by unnecessary distraction and a lack of prior knowledge that I could have invested extracurricularly through research of the materials I find interesting online.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Following the next lesson, and between this lesson and the next, I will research various areas that I find alternately interesting and challenging; in addition, i will try to keep my head down and focus on the task currently being attempted.</td>
