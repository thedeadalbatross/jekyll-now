    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt via a pre-existing textbook on the Fuzes. This was helpful, as I was still struggling with some variables, and this was a good way to learn them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by forgetting to bring in memory sticks to save my work onto; I need to develop the habit of a monk (really, I need to develop the habit of bringing in memory sticks). This week, I forgot again, and will definitely bring one in next week for conservation purposes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the following lessons, I will bring in a memory stick to preserve further information. There are few non-already-mentioned habits I need to improve to build a monastery (become more efficient). (again, the same)</td>
