    <td>In this lesson, I learnt via checking the Fuze textbook for the information we needed to complete the work. As the book included, word for word, what the task we were attempting's solution was, I was fairly confused when it did not work. However, I continued to persevere, and, eventually, we solved the evaluation problem and saved it onto a memory stick. Following this, we began work on the next tutorial, which was to complete a small text exercise in which we inputted a small conversation. Despite this not being allowed in the classroom, we worked on it; however, due to time constraints, we worked very little on this.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by a series of small grammatical errors and punctuation misplacements; this is fairly ironic as I go to a grammar school. These habits of not entirely spell checking could limit me, so I must work on these.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson, I will RECLAIM THE HOLY LAND (or, more accurately, I will follow on from my learning by continuing to be intuitive and by copying and learning in general). In addition to this, I will focus, and be a generally good student.
