    <td>Explanation by teacher. Following of tutorials from books. I found neither of these very effective: teacher explanation because my nervousness about getting it wrong and getting in trouble or falling behind interfered with my ability to concentrate properly; books because writing out the information did not make me feel more confident about working independently.</td>

    <td>Next time I will recognise before I go into the lesson that I have negative expectations about my learning and my capabilities in this subject. My negative my expectations are limiting the potential I can see for this to be an informative and fun, challenging subject.</td>
