 (add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I added a code to create the tables, but didn't change the visibility.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt in this lesson via using Google searches to generate codes for colours, and copying the code for tables to be shown properly. The strategies used were copying and pasting, typing and simple ingenuity. These strategies were effective, as I could work the MINIMUM POSSIBLE AMOUNT while still learning. This was a pleasant departure from the usual challenge (SARCASM! SARCASM! SARCASM!).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson, my learning was limited by a repressed timeframe. Had I been given more time (whether a minute or decade), I may have progressed further in the lesson, and stopped the horribly garish colour scheme then, not now. I should work on measuring my time properly, as this hindered the amount of work I could do in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will attempt, from now onwards, NOT ONLY to bring a memory stick (again, Maddox, you IDIOT) but to measure my time equally between the different areas of work; for example, I should work 30 minutes on editing the colour scheme, 30 minutes on incorporating hidden cats on every other blog. This will help, as I will progress further in lessons, and can do additional work at home which not only supplements my learning but advances it to new levels.</td>
