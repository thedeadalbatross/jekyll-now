Today in IT we consulted various problems people had uploading the tables, colours and images to our Github blogs. If a certain problem was detected by the code, we would be notified in the settings page which line of code was the error. We then changed the colours of our background; this is achieved by replacing the white in the background with the code for a different colour (eg **#66ff33**). In a similar way, we can change the default font from Helvetica to whatever we choose.
