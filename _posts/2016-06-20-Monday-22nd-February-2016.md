In IT today, we were looking at the personality sheets we had made (to see how we want to be seen on the Internet) and judged each other. My complaints and comments usually consisted of: "please use colour next time"; I'm giving people the benefit of the doubt, as Iâ€™m sure they were unaware that I do not own a colour printer. However, it was interesting to see how some people wanted to be seen online. Our homework is to share our personality poster to Google Classroom.
