In IT, we fed back the results from our parental (or other similarly connected person) interviews about technology. After getting these back, we discussed which responses had been the most surprising. Following this, we had another discussion of how one can be misconstrued based on their representative social media accounts. For example, Aaron's mother could have been seen as a binge-drinking partier, whereas in reality she very rarely touches alcohol. My mother looks like an angry, politically charged academic, and in reality she is a politically charged, angry academic.
