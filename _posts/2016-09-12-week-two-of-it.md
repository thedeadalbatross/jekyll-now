  <tr>
    <td>I learnt this via cooperation with my partner and the suggested strategies present in the Fuze tutorial book. This, in theory, was very effective, as I learnt to assign values to text, and to print the text as that value.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by trying, repeatedly, to work out the solutions on my own. I need to become less scared of asking for help, and more effective in collaborative work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson, I will attempt to successfully assign values to certain phrases (as this did not occur this time), and will attempt to collaborate more with the people in my direct environment by asking for assistance and loosening the fears I irrationally have. </td>
