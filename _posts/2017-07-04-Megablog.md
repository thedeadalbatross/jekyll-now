What I've done 

-Pyg Latin, or using Python's capabilities to be able to take a word and translate it to Pig Latin

-basic functionalities, like defining a preference and being able to tell and print the time

-conditionals and control flow, so ifs and ors (this was the most difficult part)

-creating a tip calculator by finding a base percentage of a bill (integer)

-basic Python syntax, so learning how to incorporate indents, colons and semicolons

While some portions of Python learning has certainly been challenging, I feel that I have enjoyed every part. From the generated insult box to my custom-made Instant Cthulhu Summoner v.1.2.0 (using print output, markup, booleans, len functions and defining preferences), it has all been great, and  I look forward to the next lesson.
